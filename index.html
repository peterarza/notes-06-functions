        <h1>Functions in Javascript</h1>

        <p>Functions are important and valuable tools in programming. They are used to encapsulate and create reusable code. There are a number of ways to create functions in JS, the most common way is by using the function keyword. After you have created a function you must invoke or call it in order to run the code that it contains.</p>

<h1>Scoping Global and Local</h1>
            
<p>Scoping is the concept of where your variables can be accessed. There are 2 major scopes: Global and Local. Global scope variables are those that exist <strong>outside</strong> of loops, functions objects etc. Local scope variables are those that exist <strong>inside</strong> of loops, functions, objects etc.</p>

<p>Global scope also means that variables can be used by anything outside of your code. As a result they can be overwritten. Global scope variables are not recommended for sensitive data such as user info, password or anything that should be kept secret.</p>

<p id="scope1"></p>

<p>Global scope variables are typically declared in the main document and outside of any functions or objects. They're therefore accessible by all functions in the document. However they run the risk of being overwritten, may create security loopholes and cause some code efficiency problems.</p>

<p id ="scope2"></p>

<p>Local scope vars are declared inside of a function or object. They are only accessible by their parent element that they are declared inside of. These local variables run less risk of being overwritten because you must first reach into the function to access them. In modern, standards compliant JS, its highly recommended to work mostly in local scope variables.</p>

<h1>Passing Arguments</h1>

<p>When a function is able to take in arguments, you can use those arguments to perform actions specific to the function. This is referred to as, 'passing an argument to the function'. Most of the time, you pass arguments into a function in order for them to be used in some way.  After use, the result is typically returned so that element outside of the function can use the returned value.</p>

<p id="arguments"></p>

<p>Passing arguments is a very common programming technique. It can be used for calculations as simple as adding 2 numbers, or as complex as equations.</p>

<h1>Conditionals in Functions</h1>
<p>Functions can run more complex operations such as loops and conditionals.</p>
